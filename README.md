# Ephorus Assignment
This building block provides an Ephorus integration with Blackboard. Instructors can create specific Ephorus assignments in their courses, for which all submitted work will be scanned by Ephorus for plagiarism.

Note that Turnitin (who bought Ephorus a few years ago) has discontinued the Ephorus product on September 1st 2020. You can still use the building block to view reports on documents uploaded before September 1st, as these reports are stored in your Blackboard database.

## Release Notes

### 3800.201216.0
- compatible with Blackboard 2019 Q4 and 2020 (also known as "3900"); compiled with Java 11 so not compatible with older Blackboard versions
- the webservice for receiving reports has been disabled to make the building block work in 3900; not a problem since Ephorus is no longer sending reports anyway
